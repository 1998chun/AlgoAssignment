Lula Says He Is Obsessed in Unmasking Moro and that The Government Is A "Gang of Crazy People"

He also said Supreme Court has shown courage in the past

In his first interview in prison, at the Curitiba Federal Police headquarters, the ex-president  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) said that the election of Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) should make the Brazilian elite self-reflect. 

“We can’t have this country being governed by a gang of crazy people,” he said. He compared how the media treated him to the current government. “Imagine if the militia close to Bolsonaro were friends of my family.”

Lula, who received a sentence of eight years and 10 months for corruption and is awaiting trials in seven pending cases, said that he was the victim of a sham and that the ex-judge Sergio Moro knows that he is innocent.  

Lula also acknowledged the Supreme Court: The court has already shown that it has courage,” in reference to previous decisions.
