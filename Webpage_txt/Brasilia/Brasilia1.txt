Lula's STJ Sentence Reduction Is the Largest in Lava Jato

Reduction could affect other pending cases

The Brazilian Superior Court 's decision to reduce by 26 percent the sentence of ex-president Lula in the Guarujá (SP) triplex case will likely affect other Lava Jato cases judged by the court. 

In the judgment of the PT member, on Tuesday (23), the sentence fell from 12 years and 1 month to eight years, 10 months and 20 days, which might allow him to leave prison this year. 

This report looked at six other Lava Jato cases that originated in Curitiba and were judged by the court. Only two received a reduction in their sentence. The reduction was much less, from 4.5 percent to 13 percent. 

These are two separate cases that involve the same person, the operator Carlos Habib Chater, defendant of the first phase of the operation, and head of the gasoline station in the Federal District that led to the operation’s name—Lava Jato. 

In the Chater cases, the STJ rapporteur, Felix Fischer, decided to reduce the sentence when he analyzed the case individually, which was followed by the fifth panel of the STJ. In Lula’s case, the judges' initiative to change the sentence happened communally. 

After STJ’s Lula decision, the justice Gilmar Mendes said that the court, which equates to third grade in the Judiciary, sent a message to the “oversized feathers” of the regional court in Curitiba. 

In the triplex case, the sentence had been increased by two years and seven months in the first instance to the appeal in the second degree, in the TRF (Regional Federal Court) of the 4th Region.

Proportionally, there were increases in sentences in the second appeal of up to 140%. Most of the decisions of the regional court are to keep the first verdict, but it also usually increases rather than reduces sentences.
